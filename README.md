# Task50

#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:

This is a To-do web app created using Flask and Bootstrap. You can sign up for a new account, you can create, edit and
delete tasks, and of course, mark them as done.

This is my CS50's Final Project.

You can either start using the app by clicking [here](http://task50.herokuapp.com/),

or walk through the steps below to run the app locally on your machine.

## Host the app locally on your machine

### Requirements

- Install Python 3.x
- Install SQLite3

### Setting up the environment

1. Open a terminal window, run the following command to clone the
   repository `git clone https://github.com/youssef-attai/cs50_project.git`
2. `cd` to the directory `cs50_project`
3. If you don't already have virtualenv installed, run the following command `pip3 install virtualenv`
4. Run `virtualenv venv` to create a new environment called "venv"
5. Run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
6. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements in the environment

### Setting up the database

1. Run the following command `touch database.db`
2. Run the following command `export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///database.db`
3. Run the Python console typing `python` or `python3` and hitting Enter
4. Type `from app import db` and hit Enter
5. Type `db.create_all()` and hit Enter
6. Type `exit()` and hit Enter to exit the Python console
7. Make sure the database is created successfully by running `sqlite3 database.db .tables`, you should see two
   tables, `user` and `task`

### Running the app

1. Run the following command `flask run`
2. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000, you should see the app working as expected

### Existing the app

1. Just hit CTRL+C in the terminal window

## How everything works

- `app.py` is the application controller, it contains the Flask app setup, all the different routes, and model classes.
- `templates/` folder contains all the HTML templates.
- `templates/layout.html` is the base template that all other templates extend, it has important links that need to be
  in every template's `<head>` tag.
- `templates/register.html` is the template for the Registration page.
- `templates/login.html` is the template for the Login page.
- `templates/home.html` is the template for the main page.
- `templates/dashboard.html` is the template for the Dashboard page, where the user can manage their tasks.
- `templates/edit.html` is the template for the Edit page, where the user can edit a specific task determined through
  the url.
- `Procfile` is a file that tells Heroku how to run the app.
- `requirements.txt` is the result of running `pip freeze`, it includes all the dependencies needed before hosting the
  app.

When the user first opens the app, they have to register a new account. Every user must have a unique username.
All user inputs are validated server-side only, and not checked in the browser. Once the user registers successfully,
they can log in using their username and password, to be redirected to their dashboard, where they can add new tasks to
their empty to-do list. Users can edit and delete tasks, as well as marking them as "done" or "not done".
